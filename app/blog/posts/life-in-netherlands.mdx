summary: 'An honest look at what it's really like living and working as a programmer in the Netherlands - the good, the challenging, and the unexpected.'
---

Five months into living in the Netherlands as a programmer, I'm finally starting to feel like I have a handle on what life here is actually like. Before moving, I had this idealized vision shaped by articles about Dutch work-life balance and the thriving European tech scene. The reality is more nuanced, and I want to share what I've learned.

## The Tech Scene: Smaller But Growing

Coming from [or reading about] major tech hubs, the Dutch tech scene is different. It's not Silicon Valley, and it's not trying to be.

**What I've Found:**
- Amsterdam has a vibrant startup ecosystem, but it's smaller and tighter-knit than I expected
- There's a strong focus on fintech, e-commerce, and increasingly, AI/ML
- The tech community feels more collaborative than competitive
- English is widely spoken in tech, but Dutch language skills definitely help for deeper integration

**The Opportunities:**
- Growing AI/ML scene with research institutions like CWI and universities
- Companies ranging from startups to big tech (Booking.com, Adyen, etc.)
- Increasing remote work opportunities connecting you to broader European market
- Active meetup culture and tech events

## The Work Culture Shock

The Dutch approach to work is... different. It took me a while to adjust.

**What Surprised Me:**

**Direct Communication:** The Dutch are famously direct. Feedback is straightforward, almost blunt by some cultural standards. As a programmer, this means code reviews are efficient but can feel harsh initially.

**Meetings Start On Time:** If a meeting is at 10:00, it starts at 10:00. Not 10:05. Not 10:02. 10:00.

**Actual Work-Life Balance:** People really do leave at 5:30 PM. They take their vacation days. Working late isn't seen as dedication - it's seen as poor time management. This was hard to internalize at first.

**Consensus Culture:** Decision-making involves more discussion and consensus-building than I was used to. It can feel slow, but decisions stick better once made.

**Hierarchy is Flat:** Junior developers can (and should) challenge senior developers' ideas. Your title matters less than your arguments.

## The Financial Reality

Let's talk about money, because this is important for anyone considering moving here.

**Salaries:**
- Entry-level developer: €35k-50k
- Mid-level developer: €50k-70k
- Senior developer: €70k-90k+
- The 30% ruling (tax break for skilled migrants) helps significantly if you qualify

**Cost of Living:**
- Rent in Amsterdam: €1,500-2,500/month for a decent one-bedroom (yes, really)
- Rent in other cities (Utrecht, Rotterdam, Eindhoven): €1,000-1,800/month
- Groceries: €200-300/month if you cook
- Health insurance: €120-150/month (mandatory)
- Public transport: €50-100/month, or just cycle everywhere

**The Math:**
Salaries are lower than US tech hubs, but you get healthcare, better work-life balance, and strong social safety nets. It's a different value proposition.

## The Housing Crisis

I need to be honest: finding housing is probably the hardest part of living here.

- Extremely competitive rental market, especially in big cities
- Landlords often require proof of income (3-4x monthly rent)
- Waiting lists for social housing can be years long
- Buying is difficult with high prices and Dutch mortgage requirements
- Many people end up in temporary housing or shared apartments initially

This is probably my biggest frustration living here. Have a housing strategy before you move.

## The Lifestyle Perks

Once you're settled, there are genuine upsides:

**Cycling Everywhere:** No car needed. Cities are designed for bikes. It's genuinely faster and more pleasant than driving for most trips.

**Travel Access:** Weekend trips to Paris, London, Berlin, Brussels are cheap and easy. Living in Europe means really living in Europe.

**English Friendly:** In tech circles and cities, English works fine. Learning Dutch helps long-term, but you won't be isolated without it.

**Safety and Quality of Life:** Low crime, good infrastructure, clean cities, reliable public services.

**The Coffee Culture:** Incredible café culture. Good coffee, nice work-from-café options, social spaces.

## The Weather Reality

Let's not sugarcoat this: the weather is... grey. A lot.

- Winters are dark (sunset at 4:30 PM) and rainy
- Summers are pleasant but unpredictable
- You learn to plan around weather, not with it
- Vitamin D supplements become your friend
- But houses are well-insulated and cozy

The Dutch have a word, "gezellig," that captures the cozy, warm atmosphere they create to counteract the grey. You learn to embrace it.

## Integration Challenges

The Netherlands is expat-friendly, but integration takes effort:

- Making Dutch friends as an adult can be challenging
- Most of your social circle might be other internationals initially
- Bureaucracy is extensive (and everything requires DigiD)
- Learning Dutch helps significantly with feeling integrated
- The expat bubble is real and easy to stay in

## The Visa Situation

For non-EU citizens, understanding visa options is crucial:

- Highly Skilled Migrant visa is most common for tech workers
- Sponsorship requirements from employers
- Orientation year visa for recent graduates of top universities (including Dutch ones)
- Path to permanent residency after 5 years

Post-Brexit, UK citizens now need visas too. If you're from the EU, you have freedom of movement, which simplifies everything.

## My Honest Take

Would I recommend the Netherlands for programmers? It depends on what you value.

**Come here if you want:**
- Actual work-life balance
- Access to European lifestyle and travel
- Stable, quality life with good public services
- Growing tech scene with opportunities
- Bike-friendly cities and walkable neighborhoods

**Maybe reconsider if you prioritize:**
- Maximum salary potential (US pays more)
- Warm, sunny weather
- Easy housing markets
- Very large tech ecosystem with massive companies
- Low taxes (though the social benefits offset this somewhat)

## For AI/ML Specifically

As someone with an AI MSc, the Netherlands offers:
- Strong academic research institutions
- Growing AI startup scene
- European AI regulation work (interesting if you care about AI governance)
- Less saturated than some other markets
- English-language opportunities in most AI/ML roles

The salaries might not match San Francisco, but the complete package - quality of life, healthcare, work culture, location - creates a different kind of value.

## Final Thoughts

Living in the Netherlands as a programmer has been an adjustment, but mostly a positive one. The housing market is genuinely difficult, and I miss sunshine more than I expected. But the quality of life, the work culture, and being in Europe have been worth it.

The tech scene is smaller, but that means it's easier to build a network and make an impact. You're not just another developer in a sea of thousands - you can actually get to know the community.

If you're considering making the move, come with realistic expectations about salaries and housing, but also with openness to a different pace of life. The Netherlands won't make you rich quickly, but it might make you live better.

And hey, you'll get really good at cycling in the rain. That's a life skill, right?
